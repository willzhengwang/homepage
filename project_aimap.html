							<h3 align="left">Automated InSAR Monitoring of Arctic Permafrost (AIMAP)</h3>
							<p class="large" align="left">Permafrost, permanently frozen ground, is prevalent across northern Canada and in many other countries at polar latitudes.
								Above this permafrost lies an active layer which thaws in the summer and refreezes in the winter.
								Depending on the water content of this active layer, this seasonal cycle of thawing and refreezing can result in significant ground subsidence and heave as the moisture cycles back and forth between ice and liquid water.<br>
							</p>
							<p class="large" align="left">Climate change is causing Arctic temperatures to slowly increase, resulting in changes to the extent and depth of this active layer and subsequently leading to variability in the ground subsidence patterns in northern communities.
								Permafrost degradation has the potential to release carbon that is currently frozen in organic matter, in sufficient quantities to augment global climate change.
								The loss of permafrost can also lead to long term subsidence trends that can be tremendously damaging to both urban structures and long linear infrastructure projects, such as highways and pipelines. Monitoring the evolution of Arctic permafrost is therefore necessary to understand impacts on climate models, linear infrastructure and Arctic communities.
								The remote nature of the Canadian Arctic creates significant challenges for wide scale monitoring. Interferometric Synthetic Aperture Radar (InSAR) provides the potential for monitoring conditions across wide swaths of the Arctic, thereby providing regular monitoring of known geohazards and allowing for the identification of thousands of previously unknown hazards.<br>
							</p>
							<p class="large" align="left">3vGeomatics (3vG), with the funding support of the Canadian Space Agency, is currently working on an Automated InSAR Monitoring of Arctic Permafrost (AIMAP) project to develop the capacity to efficiently and effectively monitor wide areas of Arctic terrain with an automated processing chain.
								The project is initially utilizing data from the Sentinel-1 constellation due to the widespread data availability.
								This is backed up by several footprints of RADARSAT-2 data over 3 locations where a deep temporal archive is available.
								The automated workflow, however, is being designed to extend to the Radarsat Constellation Mission (RCM) and NiSAR as those data becomes available.<br>
							</p>
							<p class="large" align="left">The AIMAP project has three primary objectives.
								First, 3vG has developed an automated snow detection routine utilizing both SAR data and optical Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) Snow Cover products.
								These snow cover maps can be used to identify and remove areas with either reduced coherence from snow cover or areas with added phase signal due to the presence of snow.
								Secondly, 3vG has deployed a backprojection code (pers. comms. Prof. H. Zebker, Stanford) to enable raw sentinel data to be directly projected into map (ground) geometry, rather than requiring the data to first be processed in range-dopper coordinates.
								Such a routine allows the inclusion of Sentinel-1 EW data, which is widely available in the polar regions, but only provided by ESA in raw (L0) format.
								Finally, 3vG is developing strategies to classify and distinguish the seasonally cyclical component of InSAR signals from ongoing secular displacement.
								Such strategies are critical for characterizing the degradation of permafrost and identifying long term displacement trends that can prove damaging to existing and future infrastructure projects.
